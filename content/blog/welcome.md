# Welcome

Welcome to my blog. My name is Tito Garrido Ogando and this is my [~~first~~](https://titosoft.github.io) second attempt to create a blog about interesting stuff that I have been studying.

The idea is to share interesting topics about Python, AI, Javascript, Linux, and other areas I have been studying, especially tools for web development and infrastructure automation.

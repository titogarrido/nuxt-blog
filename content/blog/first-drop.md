# First Drop

Welcome to my blog. My name is Tito Garrido Ogando and this is my first attempt to create a blog about interesting stuff that I have been studying.

The idea is to share some How-to's regarding Python, z/VM (Mainframe hypervisor), KVM (on x86 and s390x), and interesting tools for web development and infrastructure automation.
